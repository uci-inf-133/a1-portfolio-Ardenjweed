--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
Appropriate headings and paragraph text
Links to external page(s)
Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them
Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer


(b) CSS features
Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab
Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner


(c) Advanced features
Creating a table with multiple columns and rows which can be read via a screen reader
Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
Leveraging nested selectors to specify format
A contact form which leverages HTML forms



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I got some errors relating to the fact that my input for the contact form didn't have labels. I ignored this because aesthetically it looked more pleasing along with the fact that I had read
screen readers may use the placeholder value out loud.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
Maybe around 6 hours


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I looked at the bootstrap website a lot for their resources. Too many subpages to list from coloring, text, text shadows, sizing/formatting, navbar, images, etc.

I was aware that formspree was a website that could implement contact forms so I looked at how they wanted their form/form action set up.
